# IIT Madras iGEM 2025

Welcome to the IIT Madras iGEM 2025 team documentation. We are participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, working on innovative solutions in synthetic biology.

## Essential First Steps

Familiarize yourself with the official iGEM competition rules, policies, and judging criteria:

- Carefully review the [Wiki Requirements page](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki) to ensure your wiki meets all necessary standards for judging and awards.
- Understand the criteria and required wiki pages for Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals on the [Medals page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/medals).
- Explore the various Project Prizes and their corresponding wiki requirements on the [Project Prizes Page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/project-prizes).
- Discover the eligibility criteria and wiki requirements for Special Prizes on the [Special Prizes Page](https://competition.igem.org/judging/special-prizes).

## Building Your Wiki

- **Content First, Design Second**: Focus on clearly documenting your project, research, and activities. Design can be refined later.
- **Navigation is Key**: Structure your wiki with clear and intuitive navigation. Visitors should easily find information.
- **Accessibility Matters**: Use readable fonts, appropriate color contrast, and ensure your wiki is mobile-friendly.
- **Media Optimization**: Compress images and videos to reduce file sizes and improve loading times.
- **Document Early & Often**: Start documenting your project from day one. Don't wait until the Wiki Freeze.
- **Prepare for Deadlines**: Stay up-to-date with important deadlines and events by checking the [iGEM Competition Calendar](https://competition.igem.org/calendar).

## Tips for Success

- **Clearly Define Your Project**: Explain your project's goals, methodology, and expected outcomes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Show Your Progress**: Regularly update your wiki with your team's progress, experiments, and results.
- **Engage Your Audience**: Consider your global audience and use language that is accessible to everyone.
- **Human Practices & Safety**: Thoroughly document your team's human practices activities and safety considerations.
- **Collaborate & Share**: Highlight collaborations with other teams and institutions.
- **Have Fun and Learn!** iGEM is a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to synthetic biology.
