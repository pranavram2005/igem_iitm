# Project Overview

## The EPIC System

Our team at IIT Madras presents the **EPIC System** (Epigenetic Pathway for Improved Crop characteristics) - a revolutionary approach to enhancing plant traits through targeted epigenetic modifications.

### Key Highlights

- **Target**: Enhancing plant productivity through epigenetic regulation
- **Technology**: dCas9-Dam methylation system
- **Application**: Sustainable agriculture and food security
- **Innovation**: Reversible genetic modifications without permanent DNA changes

### Project Goals

1. Develop a robust epigenetic modification system
2. Enhance crop yield and stress resistance
3. Create sustainable agricultural solutions
4. Provide a reversible alternative to traditional genetic modification

### Expected Impact

Our EPIC System aims to revolutionize agriculture by providing farmers with crops that can adapt to changing environmental conditions while maintaining natural genetic integrity.
