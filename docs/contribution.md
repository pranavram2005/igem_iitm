# Contribution

## Experimental

### Experimental Foundation and Plasmid Systems

We successfully cloned and worked with multiple plasmid systems, including **pdCas9**, **recombinant dCas9-Dam**, and **dnaAP2-GFP**, building the foundation for programmable transcriptional regulation in our project. These validated constructs provide a robust starting point for teams working on CRISPR-based epigenetic regulation systems.

### Novel dCas9-Dam Construct Engineering

We engineered a **novel dCas9-Dam construct through in-fusion cloning**, verified it by sequencing, and confirmed positive recombinants. This construct is central to our project's mechanism and represents a key experimental milestone. The successful fusion of dCas9 with Dam methyltransferase creates a programmable epigenetic tool that future teams can build upon for targeted DNA methylation applications.

### Troubleshooting Protocols and Optimization Strategies

Through persistence in troubleshooting, we developed workarounds for failed cloning attempts, including:
- Testing alternative ligation ratios
- Optimizing digestion conditions  
- Modifying DNA purification steps to improve yield and purity

These troubleshooting strategies and optimized protocols provide valuable guidance for future teams facing similar experimental challenges.

### Standardized Guide RNA Cloning Workflow

We standardized a comprehensive workflow for **guide RNA cloning into pdCas9**, including:
- Annealing protocols
- Digestion optimization
- Ligation procedures
- Colony PCR screening methods

Even though early attempts failed due to expired reagents and non-specific primers, we established an optimized protocol with proper controls, which can now serve as a reference for future teams working on guide RNA integration.

### Co-transformation Validation

We carried out **co-transformation experiments with dnaAP2-GFP and dCas9-Dam plasmids** to demonstrate compatibility and lay the groundwork for downstream functional testing. This validation work provides important proof-of-concept data for multi-plasmid systems in epigenetic regulation applications.

### Competent Cell Preparation and Validation

Our team prepared and validated highly competent **E. coli XL1-Blue cells** and **dam-negative competent cells**, creating reliable stocks for use in methylation-sensitive experiments. These validated cell lines are crucial resources for teams working on DNA methylation projects.

We ideated on a **novel memory encoding system for E. coli using methylation**, which has several applications in:
- Bio-sensors
- Memory-regulated biomanufacturing
- Programmable cellular memory systems

This conceptual framework opens new avenues for synthetic biology applications in cellular memory and information storage.
