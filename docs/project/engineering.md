# Engineering Success

This page documents our engineering approach, iterative design process, and the success of our engineering solutions.

## Engineering Design Cycle

Our project follows the engineering design cycle:

1. **Define the Problem**
2. **Brainstorm Solutions** 
3. **Design and Build**
4. **Test and Evaluate**
5. **Iterate and Improve**

## Design Iterations

### Iteration 1: Initial Design
*[Describe your first design approach]*

<div className="image-gallery">
  <ImageContainer 
    src="/img/design-v1.svg" 
    alt="Initial Design Version 1" 
    caption="Design Version 1: Initial prototype concept"
    width="100%"
  />
  <ImageContainer 
    src="/img/results-v1.svg" 
    alt="Version 1 Results" 
    caption="Testing results from first iteration"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

### Iteration 2: Improved Design
*[Describe how you improved based on initial results]*

### Iteration 3: Final Design
*[Describe your final optimized design]*

## Success Metrics

*[Define how you measure the success of your engineering]*

## Results and Analysis

*[Present your engineering results and analysis]*

## Future Improvements

*[Discuss potential future engineering improvements]*

:::tip Engineering Tips
- Document all design decisions and rationale
- Show clear evidence of iterative improvement
- Include quantitative data where possible
- Discuss both successes and failures
- Consider manufacturing and scalability
