## What Should this Page Contain?

This page should contain:

- The standard navigation menu of your wiki
- The standard footer of your wiki
- The embedded iframe containing your standardized team's Project Attribution form
- Nothing else

## Tips for Success

Teams must use the official Attributions form. This form clearly delineates the work conducted by your team members and the support received from others. Carefully review the instructions and requirements of this deliverable on the [Project Attribution page](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/project-attribution). Please note:

- Teams must use the standard form. Do not create your own form.
- The standard Attributions Form must be filled out completely, accurately and honestly.
- For the best results, we recommend teams start filling out the Attributions Form early in the season and updating it often.

## Official Attribution Form

The official iGEM attribution form will be embedded below when the team ID is configured:

<!-- The attribution form iframe will be embedded here when properly configured -->
<div style={{width: "100%", minHeight: "600px", border: "1px solid #ccc", borderRadius: "4px", padding: "20px", textAlign: "center", backgroundColor: "#f8f9fa"}}>
  <p><strong>iGEM Attribution Form</strong></p>
  <p>The official attribution form will be displayed here once the team configuration is complete.</p>
  <p>This form is required for Bronze Medal Criterion #2.</p>
</div>

:::warning Important
LEAVE THE IFRAME CODE AS IT IS WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT IT. THE ATTRIBUTION FORM OF YOUR TEAM WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THIS PAGE. DO NOT REMOVE IT, OTHERWISE YOU RISK NOT MEETING BRONZE MEDAL CRITERION #2.
