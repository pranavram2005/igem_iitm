            Provide comprehensive, step-by-step protocols for all experiments
            conducted. Include a list of materials, reagents, and equipment
            used. Specify concentrations, volumes, incubation times,
            temperatures, and other critical parameters. Document any
            modifications or optimizations made to standard protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explain the purpose of each experiment and its relevance to your
            project goals. Describe the experimental design, including controls
            and replicates. Provide a clear rationale for the chosen methods and
            approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Document any troubleshooting steps taken and optimizations made
            during the experimental process. Share any lessons learned that
            could benefit future teams.
