            <h4>Best Plant Synthetic Biology</h4>
            <p>
              This award is designed to celebrate exemplary work done in plant
              synthetic biology. Did you build a project in a plant chassis? Did
              you submit plant parts to the Registry? This award could also be
              given to a team working with algae or another eukaryotic
              photosynthetic chassis. Show us what you made and remember to
              adhere to iGEM safety guidelines!
